        <p>Everything you see and experience in a webpage, application, mobile 
        application or a system is called frontend. </br>
        It includes everything that you as a user experience directly: text, 
        colors and styles, images, graphs and tables, buttons and navigation menu. </br>
        -Frontend is the interface with which the user interacts- </br>
        It prescribes how functions and information are to be presented, as well 
        as how the website is to function in general, where focus is on usability 
        and creating a good experience for the user.
